### Abstract

Here is a little more surrounding my interests. Many of them have lengthy acronyms.

## 1. HIT-SI Experiment

**Stands for:** Helicity Injection Torus, Steady Inductive

The HIT-SI experiment researches a certain approach to nuclear fusion energy under the A&A department [[1](#1)]. I currently work as a student assistant,
helping with CAD modeling and assembly of the experiment.

**Stands for:** Astronomy Undergraduate Engineering Group

Within the UW Dept. of Astronomy, the student organization centers on engineering instrumentation used in Astronomy (ex. telescopes, microcomputers).
As club liaison and member, I manage club meeting minutes and help with maintenance at the Manastash Ridge Observatory, a telescope owned by the UW open to student use.

**Stands for:** Students for the Exploration and Development of Space

SEDS is another student organization I participate in, but it is under the A&A department [[2](#2)]. The club hosts projects and research on a wide variety of topics
in A&A, such as multi-stage rocket design, plasma sails, and space policy. As of now, I manage a project paper subgroup within SEDS for the competition SEDS-SSPI (Space & Satellite Professionals International). The paper centers on manufacturing and industry in space (i.e. mining asteroids).
